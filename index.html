                    <p>
                        I am a hard working husband to a great wife and the father to two amazing daughters.
                        I have stuck with jobs for 5+ years where I advanced up the ranks.
                        For example, I used to work at a fine dining restaurant as a busser.  From there, I worked my way up to
                        washing dishes, then catering, then baking, frying, plating, making the side dishes, and even running the
                        grill as the sous chef.  We often served business owners during their meetings, wedding proposal dinners, wedding receptions, and even high-ranking government officials.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My family and I moved down to Florida where I worked at a factory.  Through hard work and paying attention, I became an all-around employee who they could rely on
                    to produce results for the company in practically any positon.  Shipping/Receiving, Saw Operation,
                    Machine Operation, Forklift Operation (including hauling around barrels), and so on.
                </p>
                    While there, my wife started going to <span id="UCF"></span> for her dream job as an Elementary School Teacher.
                    I was dedicated to helping her achieve this dream and teach the next generation.
                    However, we could not afford to pay the bills as she did unpaid internships .
                    So I hit the road as an Over-The-Road Truck Driver to make the money we needed fast.  The product needed to be hauled in regular box trailers,
                    in refridgerated trailers, or flat-bed?  It's hazardous material?  It needed to be unloaded by hand in inclement weather conditions in areas with
                    high crime?  I was qualified, knowledgeable, and willing to do it without complaint!  I unloaded in downtown Baltimore, Detroit, Los Angeles,
                    San Francisco, and other areas with weather from over 120 degress to less than -25.
