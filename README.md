This is my portfolio page which is used to show potential employers and others my skills.  
It is very basic right now due to time constraints imposed by working 40 hours a week, doing an online coding bootcamp for about 30 hours,
and having a family.  However, it will be modified a lot more once my schedule frees up after the coding bootcamp is complete.
